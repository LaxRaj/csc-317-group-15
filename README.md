ðŸŒŽ Climate Crisis: The Defining Crisis of Our Time
==================================================

This is a single-page website created for a group project (CSC-317 Group 15). The goal is to provide concise, well-sourced information on the causes, effects, and actions related to climate change, presented in a clean, modern, and high-performance design.

The current version represents a comprehensive code clean-up and aesthetic redesign to improve readability, accessibility, and overall user experience.

âœ¨ Project Highlights & Redesign
-------------------------------

The submission incorporates several modern design and development practices to transform the site from a basic layout into a professional-grade single-page application.

### Code and Structure Optimization

*   **Semantic HTML5:** Replaced non-semantic div usage with structural tags (
    
    ,
    
    ,
    
    ,
    
    ,
    
    ) to improve accessibility and SEO.
    
*   **Separation of Concerns:** All styling was externalized to assets/css/style.css, ensuring the HTML file remains clean, modular, and easy to maintain.
    
*   **Performance:** The code structure was optimized for speed, ensuring a **non-laggy** and instant user experience.
    

### Aesthetic and User Experience (UX)

*   **Modern Aesthetic:** Implemented a **minimalist, high-contrast** design using the **Montserrat** font and a clean, thematic color palette (Forest Green and vibrant Orange accents).
    
*   **Full Responsiveness:** The layout is **mobile-first**, utilizing CSS Grid and media queries to ensure perfect content stacking and readability on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
    
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Subtle, high-performance CSS animations (@keyframes pulse on the hero image) and smooth hover transitions (on the **"Go Beyond"** organization cards) were added to enhance engagement without slowing performance.
